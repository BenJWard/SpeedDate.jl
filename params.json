  "body": "# SpeedDate.jl\r\n\r\nA deliberately simple tool for the estimation of divergence times between sequences.\r\nCreated with julia and [Bio.jl](https://github.com/BioJulia/Bio.jl)\r\n\r\n## Quick Start\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nEnter in a Julia terminal:\r\n```julia\r\nPkg.clone(\"https://github.com/Ward9250/SpeedDate.jl.git\")\r\n```\r\nTo download and install the master branch. Note the master branch is ahead\r\nof any release and so may contain bugs of incomplete features.\r\n\r\n### Useage\r\n\r\nTo use the SpeedDate program on the command line, invoke julia like so:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\njulia -e\"using SpeedDate; SpeedDate.main()\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `compute` command is invoked to compute genetic distances and coalescence times\r\nfor an input aligned FASTA file. Use the -h flag to display the possible options\r\nfor the `compute` command:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\njulia -e\"using SpeedDate; SpeedDate.main()\" compute -h\r\n\r\nusage: <PROGRAM> compute [-f FILE] [-s [DNASEQS...]] [-m MODEL]\r\n                        [-r MUTATION_RATE] [--method METHOD]\r\n                        [-o OUTFILE] [--scan] [-w WIDTH] [-j STEP]\r\n                        [--onlydist] [-h]\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -f, --file FILE       An input file.\r\n  -s, --dnaseqs [DNASEQS...]\r\n                        The first of two DNA sequences to test (type:\r\n                        Bio.Seq.BioSequence{Bio.Seq.DNAAlphabet{4}})\r\n  -m, --model MODEL     The model used to compute genetic distances.\r\n                        Currently jc69, and k80 are supported.\r\n                        (default: \"jc69\")\r\n  -r, --mutation_rate MUTATION_RATE\r\n                        The mutation rate to be assumed. (type:\r\n                        Float64, default: 1.0e-8)\r\n  --method METHOD       The dating method to use. Currently 'default'\r\n                        and 'simple' are supported.  (default:\r\n                        \"default\")\r\n  -o, --outfile OUTFILE\r\n                        Base name for the output files(s). (default:\r\n                        \"SpeedDate\")\r\n  --scan                Whether or not to compute dates across\r\n                        sequences with a sliding window.\r\n  -w, --width WIDTH     Width of the sliding window across sequences.\r\n                        (type: Int64, default: 100)\r\n  -j, --step STEP       The number of base pairs the sliding window\r\n                        moves by each iteration. (type: Int64,\r\n                        default: -1)\r\n  --onlydist\r\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\r\n```\r\n\r\n_A note about unit tests, as SpeedDate essentially wraps Bio.jl functionality in a command line or GTK gui, no unit tests have been included yet, as the functions used have their own unit tests in the BioJulia project in which they are defined._ \r\n",
