            "text": "The divergence time is estimated using the number of mutations that have occurred between two aligned sequences.  The calculation uses a strict molecular clock which assumes a constant substitution rate, both through time and across taxa.  Modelling the mutation accumulation process as a Bernoulli trial, the probability of observing $k$ or fewer mutations between two sequences of length $n$ can be given as:  $$\nPr(X \\le k) = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\lfloor k \\rfloor} \\binom{n}{i} p^i (1 - p)^{n-i}\n$$  Where $p$ is the probability of observing a single mutation between the two aligned sequences.  The value of $p$ depends on two key factors: the substitution rate and the divergence time.  If you assume a molecular clock, whereby two DNA sequences are both accumulating mutations at a rate $\\mu$ for $t$ generations, then you may define $p = 2\\mu t$.  Using these assumptions, the SpeedDate method finds the root of the following formula for $Pr(X \\le k) = 0.05$, $0.5$, and $0.95$, and then divides the three answers by twice the assumed substitution rate.  $$\nf(n, k, 2\\mu t, Pr(X \\le k) = \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{\\lfloor k \\rfloor} \\binom{n}{i} {2\\mu t}^i (1 - 2\\mu t)^{n-i}   \\right) - Pr(X \\le k)\n$$  This results in an upper, middle, and lower estimate of the coalescence time $t$ of the two sequences (expressed as the number of generations).  This method has been written into the Phylo module of the flagship package of the BioJulia project, Bio.jl as a function called  coaltime , and SpeedDate simply bundles the steps of loading data, conting mutations in sequences, and passing that information to  coaltime , and writing results to file, easier.",
